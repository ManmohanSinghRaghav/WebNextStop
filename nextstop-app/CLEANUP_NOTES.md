## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed i18n libraries (~30KB savings)
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Fewer files and dependencies to maintain
3. **Better Performance**: No translation lookups or complex state management
4. **Easier Development**: Clearer code structure and simpler components
5. **Focused Features**: App now focuses on core passenger functionality

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Add Loading States**: Better loading indicators throughout the app
2. **Error Boundaries**: Add error handling for component crashes
3. **Offline Support**: Cache map data for offline viewing
4. **Push Notifications**: Notify users when their bus is approaching
5. **Favorites**: Allow users to save favorite routes/stops
6. **Search**: Add search functionality for stops and routes

The app is now much simpler, more maintainable, and focused on delivering core value to passengers.
